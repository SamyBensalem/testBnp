# testBnp

please launch it with junit, i used TDD

regards

ps: i know that a "new BasketImpl" remains in my test class, i tried to suppress it using spring in
order to close my app to any code modification but a bug remained, as i was not able to fix it i prefered 
let it like this for the moment and as matter of fact keep a functional app
